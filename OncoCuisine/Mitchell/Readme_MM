The current status of the Oncocuisine database.
The mapping of food items to an The Oncocuisine database is currently undergoing development. The process of mapping food items to a unique identifier is underway. This involves linking data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to obtain comprehensive nutrient information. Subsequently, this nutritional data will be integrated with two recipe tables, and these food items will then be associated with a symptoms table.
A major logical error exists within my project's data tables. My attempt to link five USDA website databases using the FDC ID as a foreign key was flawed. This is because the FDC ID is not a stable, unique identifier for food items on the USDA website. “The FDC_ID is the number provided for each food data record in FoodData Central. A food record is the totality of information (e.g., values for components, including nutrients, descriptive information) published on a food item. Each time the data in a food record changes, that food item receives a new FDC_ID number. ”
