# OncoCuisine: Database

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is currently under heavy development.
> Methods and results are still preliminary and subject to change.

This system is a medical-focused recipe database integrating USDA nutritional data, ingredient classification, and symptom tracking. It supports personalized meal recommendations tailored to medical conditions (e.g., cancer), dietary restrictions, and user preferences. Pre-calculated nutrition summaries, scalable architecture, and advanced analytics enable efficient recommendations, medical nutrition therapy, and population-level dietary insights.

## Development

## Data Sources Utilized
USDA FoodData Central API: Supplies comprehensive and standardized nutritional, classification, and identifier (FDC_ID, NDB, GTIN) data for raw and packaged foods.
Hugging Face recipe.txt Dataset: Provides a broad set of recipe text and metadata, supporting the population of the recipe catalog and enabling NLP-driven categorization or ingredient extraction.

## Next Steps
- Continue development of the **Oncocuisine food item mapping** to ensure accurate linkage between recipes and medical dietary classifications.  
- Design and refine the **Entity-Relationship (ER) model** for the database.  
- Clarify food item identifiers, noting that **FDC_ID is not a globally unique primary key** in USDA data.  
- Define the **entity types** required to represent USDA nutrition and food records.  
- Establish the **relationship types** to capture connections between recipes, ingredients, and USDA datasets.  
- Specify **key attributes** for USDA data entities to support nutritional analysis and medical applications.
