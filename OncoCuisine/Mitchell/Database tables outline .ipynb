    "\n",
    "### Core Recipe Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "**RECIPE_INFO_1** serves as the master recipe table, containing essential recipe metadata including the unique SKU identifier, recipe name, detailed preparation instructions, serving size information, and categorization. The table also maintains audit trails with creation and update timestamps, enabling version control and recipe management over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**RECIPE_INFO_2** This table serves as the recipe ingredients table, providing a detailed breakdown of each recipe's components. It establishes a many-to-one relationship with the master recipe table via the SKU foreign key and connects to food classification data through the NDB or FDC_ID foreign keys. Each ingredient entry may include FDC_ID, NDB, or GTIN (Global Trade Item Number) to link with USDA FoodData Central. Ingredient records also specify precise amounts and measurement units, enabling accurate recipe scaling and nutritional analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Food Classification and Nutrition Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "**TREATMENT** acts as a food classification system specifically designed for medical dietary applications. Each FDC_ID entry categorizes foods by protein family, cancer treatment relevance, and diet type compatibility. This table serves as a bridge between raw ingredient data and medical dietary requirements, enabling the system to make informed recommendations based on specific health conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SYMPTOM** This table serves as the recipe ingredients table, providing a detailed breakdown of each recipe's components. It establishes a many-to-one relationship with the master recipe table via the SKU foreign key and connects to food classification data through the NDB or FDC_ID foreign keys. Each ingredient entry may include FDC_ID, NDB, or GTIN (Global Trade Item Number) to link with USDA FoodData Central. Ingredient records also specify precise amounts and measurement units, enabling accurate recipe scaling and nutritional analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NUTRIENT_INFO** contains comprehensive nutritional data sourced from the USDA Food Data Central database. This extensive table captures detailed nutritional profiles including proximates (water, energy, protein, fats), carbohydrates and fiber content, essential minerals (calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, zinc, copper, manganese, selenium), vitamins (C, B-complex, A), and specialized compounds such as carotenoids, lycopene, and lutein. This granular nutritional data enables precise dietary analysis and supports medical nutrition therapy applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### User Management and Personalization Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "**USER_INFO** maintains comprehensive user profiles including personal demographics, dietary restrictions, preferences, and medical conditions. The table specifically tracks cancer type information, enabling personalized recipe recommendations based on medical dietary requirements. Registration tracking and active status monitoring support user lifecycle management.\n",
    "\n",
    "**USER_RECIPES** creates a personalized recipe management system, allowing users to save favorite recipes, provide ratings, and add personal notes. This table enables the system to learn user preferences over time and improve recommendation accuracy. The status field supports recipe organization and workflow management.\n",
    "\n",
    "**RECIPE_CATEGORIES** implements a structured recipe classification system with category names, descriptions, and dietary tags. This table enables efficient recipe filtering and browsing, supporting users in finding recipes that match their dietary requirements and preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**USER_RECOMMENDATIONS** stores personalized recipe suggestions generated by the system's recommendation algorithm. Each recommendation includes a compatibility score based on the user's profile, explanation of why the recipe was recommended, and tracking of user interaction. This table supports continuous improvement of the recommendation system through user feedback analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**RECIPE_NUTRITIONAL_SUMMARY** provides pre-calculated nutritional totals for each recipe, optimizing system performance by eliminating the need for real-time nutritional calculations. The table includes essential macronutrient totals, allergen warnings, and calculation timestamps for data freshness validation.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Certainly! Below is an updated and reorganized version of the requested topics, making your data model and system description clearer and more cohesive:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Primary Data Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recipe-Ingredient Linkage:**\n",
    "Each recipe in the master table (**RECIPE_INFO_1**) is linked to multiple ingredient entries in the **RECIPE_INFO_2** table via the SKU foreign key, forming a one-to-many relationship. Ingredient records in turn are linked to food items in USDA FoodData Central (by FDC_ID, NDB, or GTIN), enabling precise ingredient identification and nutritional mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Food Classification \\& Medical Relevance:**\n",
    "The **TREATMENT** table connects food item identifiers (FDC_ID) to medically relevant classifications, bridging nutritional data and treatment needs. This sets up connections between particular food ingredients and their appropriateness for various diet types or medical contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Symptom Tracking:**\n",
    "The **SYMPTOM** table forms direct relationships between specific food items (via NDB, GTIN, or FDC_ID) and tracked symptoms. Each food-symptom association stores an effect score (−1: symptom worsened; 0: no change; 1: improved), allowing analysis of dietary impact on health outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**User Personalization:**\n",
    "Users (in **USER_INFO**) interact with recipes in multiple ways—by saving favorites, rating, and managing personal notes through **USER_RECIPES**—and receive tailored recommendations via **USER_RECOMMENDATIONS.** User dietary needs and medical profiles personalize all filtering and recommendations delivered by the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Categorization and Analysis Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recipe Classification:** Recipes are categorized within **RECIPE_CATEGORIES** (e.g., by cuisine, diet type, texture), making it easy to analyze and filter for user-specific needs.\n",
    "- **Nutritional Data Aggregation:** Nutritional information for each ingredient (from **NUTRIENT_INFO**) is aggregated at the recipe level in **RECIPE_NUTRITIONAL_SUMMARY** for efficient querying, supporting dietary analysis and allergen warnings.\n",
    "- **Medical and Dietary Intersection:** The **TREATMENT** table allows for combining ingredient data with medical guidelines, enabling granular analysis of recipes by treatment protocols and dietary restrictions.\n",
    "- **Symptom-Based Insights:** Data from the **SYMPTOM** table enables mining of relationships between consumed foods and symptom outcomes, supporting both population-level trend analysis and personalized dietary adjustment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Sources Utilized\n",
    "\n",
    "- **USDA FoodData Central API:** Supplies comprehensive and standardized nutritional, classification, and identifier (FDC_ID, NDB, GTIN) data for raw and packaged foods.\n",
    "- **Hugging Face recipe.txt Dataset:** Provides a broad set of recipe text and metadata, supporting the population of the recipe catalog and enabling NLP-driven categorization or ingredient extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
