### Core Recipe Tables

**RECIPE_INFO_1** serves as the master recipe table, containing essential recipe metadata including the unique SKU identifier, recipe name, detailed preparation instructions, serving size information, and categorization. The table also maintains audit trails with creation and update timestamps, enabling version control and recipe management over time.

**RECIPE_INFO_2** functions as the recipe ingredients table, establishing a detailed breakdown of each recipe's components. This table creates a many-to-one relationship with the master recipe table through the SKU foreign key, while simultaneously linking to food classification data through the FDC_ID foreign key. Each ingredient entry includes specific amounts and units, allowing for precise recipe scaling and nutritional calculations.
### Food Classification and Nutrition Tables

**TREATMENT** acts as a food classification system specifically designed for medical dietary applications. Each FDC_ID entry categorizes foods by protein family, cancer treatment relevance, and diet type compatibility. This table serves as a bridge between raw ingredient data and medical dietary requirements, enabling the system to make informed recommendations based on specific health conditions.

**NUTRIENT_INFO** contains comprehensive nutritional data sourced from the USDA Food Data Central database. This extensive table captures detailed nutritional profiles including proximates (water, energy, protein, fats), carbohydrates and fiber content, essential minerals (calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, zinc, copper, manganese, selenium), vitamins (C, B-complex, A), and specialized compounds such as carotenoids, lycopene, and lutein. This granular nutritional data enables precise dietary analysis and supports medical nutrition therapy applications.
